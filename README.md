 ⚡ EV Charging Demand Prediction

This project is a *Machine Learning-powered web application* that predicts electric vehicle (EV) charging demand based on input data like temperature, usage pattern, and time. The goal is to help optimize the power grid and charging infrastructure using data-driven predictions.

The app is built using *Streamlit* for interactive UI and trained using *Scikit-learn* regression models.
